# Origins

This collection of C#.NEO smart contract examples started out as simple fork of the [neo-project/examples-csharp](https://github.com/neo-project/examples-csharp) project.  It now grown substantially (and is in a bit of a mess actually). It will never be merged back into the original project.  That's the plan for now.
